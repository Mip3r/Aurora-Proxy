# SunMoon Proxy

A lightweight web proxy UI that embeds HTML games and provides a small in-app browser/launcher.

Features implemented so far:
- Clean UI (header, hero, side actions)
- Games page with embedded iframe player
- Version check that compares local `version.txt` with a remote file and shows a popup when outdated

Games are sourced from GN-Math; credit will be shown in-app and in the project when deployed.

This project is a work in progress.
